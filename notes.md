## Disclaimer

- The things discussed in this meetup are not presenting anything related with
my research, my PhD or my day-to-day working schedule.

- This presentation is build up based on three major questions which
"hopefully" are up to now unanswered for your.

- Each section will try to cover a little bit of content connected with this
question and will give some insight to educate and enlighten the audience.

- After the presentation you should basically have a deeper understanding
about Python as a programming language and hopefully it will provide you with
some insights for future steps you are trying to achieve with Python.

## ☛ __Should you use Python 2 or Python 3?__

- **RAISE A HAND WHO IS WORKING WITH PYTHON 2.x**
- **RAISE A HAND WHO IS WORKING WITH PYTHON 3.x**
- **=>** You should work with Python 3.x

## Python 2.7 will not be maintained past 2020

- show link or screenshot of [Python 2.7 clock](https://pythonclock.org/)

## Pro's and con's to use Python 3.x vs. Python 2.x

Pro's for using Python 3:

- **check for some resources**

Con's for using Python 2:

- some library at corner edge

## Python packaging and tools


## ☛ __Is Python a compiled or interpreted programming language?__

- **RAISE A HAND IF YOU THINK IT'S COMPILED**
- **RAISE A HAND IF YOU THINK IT'S INTERPRETED**
