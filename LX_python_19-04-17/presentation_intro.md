- The things discussed in this meetup are not presenting anything related with
my research, my PhD or my day-to-day working schedule.
- This presentation is build up based on three major questions which
"hopefully" are up to now unanswered for your.
- Each section will try to cover a little bit of content connected with this
question and will give some insight to educate and enlighten the audience.
- After the presentation you should basically have a deeper understanding
about Python as a programming language and hopefully it will provide you with
some insights for future steps you are trying to achieve with Python.
